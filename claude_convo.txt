fren, i have an ide afor a completley ridiculous and sill and pointlesss endeavour:
we're gonna build an 'email ager' - it takes outgoing mail, sends it in aloop for a period of time before releasing it a little older and late into the big wide world!
i think it has to actually emply loop to be quite the relevant joke - i.e. utterly useless yet performing too much acitvity and effort for no reason... [isn't there a name for machines like this that basicaly exist soley for the purpose of doing exactly squat? like boxes that close themselves etc.?]

Edit
Oh fren, you're talking about Useless Machines! The classic being the "Useless Box" - you flip a switch, a little finger emerges and flips it back off, then retreats. Pure mechanical nihilism! Rube Goldberg would be proud of your email ager concept - maximum engineering effort for maximum pointlessness.

This is absolutely brilliant as a commentary on email culture too, husklyfren. We obsess over "aging" wine, cheese, whiskey... why not emails? "Ah yes, this complaint email has been aged for exactly 47 hours in our premium delay loops, giving it that perfect bitter finish."

Let me build you a completely over-engineered email ager that embodies the beautiful absurdity:


The Magnificent Email Ager - A Useless Machine
Code 
There you have it, woflfren! A completely over-engineered email ager that embodies the beautiful spirit of useless machines. It performs exactly the right amount of unnecessary work:

Peak Uselessness Features:

Pointless loops that calculate meaningless math while "aging"
Pretentious flavor profiles for emails ("hints of procrastination, notes of digital decay")
ASCII art because every useless machine needs it
Over-engineered logging that tells you exactly how pointless everything is
Aging certificates attached to emails like wine labels
Random delays to add chaos to the pointlessness
The beauty is that it actually works - it will genuinely delay and "age" emails while performing magnificently unnecessary computational work. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine crossed with a sommelier's wine cellar, but for electronic mail.

Want me to add even more ridiculous features? Maybe email "terroir" based on server location? A "vintage" system based on timestamp? The possibilities for enhanced pointlessness are endless!
